# Portfolio Website
This repository contains a portfolio website created for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course.<br />
For this project, I wanted to really push my knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery to give the website a clean design and as many useful functionalities as possible. Everything on this site was created by combining lessons from class and reading lots of online documentation of the languages used.<br />
My biggest hurdles for this project were the sticky header and hamburger menu, but I'm happy to say that between lots of pre-planning and research, I was able to figure out how to get then both fully up and running. I know that we will be covering more efficient ways to do this in upcoming units, but having to copy and paste all of the header and footer code so that it was running identically in all HTML, CSS, and JS files was a huge headache.<br />
I also did a lot of work adjusting all elements on the website in size and layout for desktop versus mobile, and I tested the live site link on both my Macbook Pro and iPhone 13 to make sure of this.
